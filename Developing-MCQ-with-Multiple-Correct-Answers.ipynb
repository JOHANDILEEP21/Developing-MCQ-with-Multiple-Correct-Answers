        "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis,\n",
        "from the Greek phōs, \"light\", and synthesis , \"putting together\". Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores.\n",
        "\n",
        "In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane.\n",
        "\n",
        "In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons\n",
        "from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions:\n",
        "\n",
        "these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). [5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts, which is about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization.\n",

He \\nestablished control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors ( subadars) and big zamindars \\nbegan asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre.\\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, \\nhowever, a new power was emerging on the political horizon – the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about.\\nFig. 1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson\\nAfter Aurangzeb there was no \\npowerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in  cold blood. \\nchap 1-4.indd   9 4/22/2022   2:49:25 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n10 OUR PASTS – IIIEast India Company \\nComes East\\nIn 1600, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter, the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods \\nat a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear.\\nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other \\nEuropean powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \\nThe problem was that all the companies were \\ninterested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of \\nFig. 2 –  Routes to India in the eighteenth century\\nMercantile – A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices\\nchap 1-4.indd   10 4/22/2022   2:49:26 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts \\nwere protected through fortification. \\nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable \\ntrade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \\nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of                  the river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which the Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696, it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later, it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting \\nthe Company the right to trade duty free.\\nThe Company tried continuously to press for \\nmore concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only the \\nCompany the right to trade duty free. But officials of  the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan,  \\nnot protest?\\nFig. 3 – Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras, painted by William Simpson, 1867Farman – A royal edict, a royal order\\nchap 1-4.indd   11 4/22/2022   2:49:27 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n12 OUR PASTS – IIIHow trade led to battles\\nThrough the early eighteenth century, the conflict between \\nthe Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust \\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts.    \\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated \\nin the famous Battle of Plassey.\\nThe Battle of Plassey \\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly \\ngive trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there. \\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, \\nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally,  in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for  \\nDid you know?\\nDid you know how Plassey \\ngot its name? Plassey is an anglicised pronunciation  of Palashi and the place derived its name from the palash  tree known for its \\nbeautiful red flowers that yield gulal , the powder \\nused in the festival of Holi.Fig. 4 – Robert Clive \\nPuppet – Literally, a toy \\nthat you can move with strings.

Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. \\nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major \\nvictory the Company won in India. Fig. 5 – The General Court Room, East India House, Leadenhall Street\\nThe Court of \\nProprietors of the East India Company had their meetings in the East India House on Leadenhall Street in London. This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress.\\nThe promise of riches\\nThe territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. After the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt, one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch, on 7\\n January 1759 from Calcutta: \\nBut so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself … that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms: ... Now I leave you to judge, whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces … be an object deserving the public attention ...Source 1\\nFig. 6 –  Sirajuddaulah\\nchap 1-4.indd   13 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n14 OUR PASTS – III\\nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was \\nassassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company \\nwas still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather \\ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar \\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  \\nnawabs ourselves”.\\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the \\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.  \\nCompany officials become “nabobs”\\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs.Source 2\\nThe Nawab \\ncomplains\\nIn 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders:\\nWhen they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon, which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort, surrounded it  with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls. They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs. 100,000… they rob and plunder and carry great number of the king’s subjects of both sexes into slavery into their own country … \\nchap 1-4.indd   14 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         15After the Battle of Plassey, the actual nawabs of \\nBengal were forced to give land and vast sums of \\nmoney as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1767 he left India, his Indian fortune was worth £401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide  \\nin 1774. \\nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in \\nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war, and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called  \\n“nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \\nCompany Rule Expands\\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company \\nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes, the Company forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but \\nHow did Clive \\nsee himself?\\nAt his hearing in front  of a Committee in Parliament, Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey. This is what he said:\\nConsider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me! A great prince was dependent on my pleasure; an opulent city lay at my mercy; its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles; I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone, piled on either hand with gold and jewels! Mr Chairman, at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.Source 3\\nImagine that you are a young Company official  who has been in India for a few months.

If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor-General (1798–1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\\nWhat power did the Resident have?\\nThis is what James Mill, the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland, wrote about the residents appointed by the Company. \\nWe place a resident, who really is king of the country, whatever injunctions of non-interference he may act under. As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience, and does what is agreeable \\nto the residents, that is, to the British Government, things go on quietly; they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs … but when anything of a different nature happens, the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong, then comes clashing and disturbance.\\nJames Mill (1832)\\nTipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore”\\nThe Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore.\\nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership \\nof powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1761 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close \\nFig. 8  – Tipu Sultan\\nchap 1-4.indd   16 4/22/2022   2:49:32 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         17relationship with the French in India, and modernised \\nhis army with their help. \\nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu \\nas ambitious, arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1767–69, 1780–84, 1790–92 and 1799). Only in the last – the Battle of Seringapatam – did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \\nFig. 10 – Tipu’s toy tiger \\nThis is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.  \\nYou can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle was turned, the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  toy-tiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799.Fig. 9 – Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages, painted by Daniel Orme, 1793\\nThe Company forces were \\ndefeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles. But in 1792, attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company, Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were  taken away as hostages. British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of  British power.\\nThe legend of Tipu\\nKings are often surrounded \\nby legend and their powers glorified through folklore. Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782. It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend. There he came face to face with a tiger. His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground. He battled with the tiger unarmed until he  managed to reach down and pick up the dagger. Finally, he was able to kill the tiger in the battle. After this, he came to be known as the “Tiger of Mysore”. He had the image of the tiger on his flag. \\nchap 1-4.indd   17 4/22/2022   2:49:34 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n18 OUR PASTS – IIIWar with the Marathas \\nFrom the late eighteenth century, the Company also \\nsought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy  under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) \\nwho became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. \\nIn the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817–19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \\nThe claim to paramountcy\\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For \\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, \\ncarried on the resistance. With popular support, he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in  \\nthe book.Fig. 11 – Lord Hastings. \\n \\nConfederacy – AllianceActivity\\nImagine that you have   come across two old  newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan.

Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842, and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab  \\nwas annexed.\\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\\nThe final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would “lapse”, that is, become a part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and  \\nJhansi (1854). \\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. \\nThis time the British had an added argument – they said they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \\nFig. 13  – Maharaja Ranjit Singh holding court  \\nFig. 14   – A portrait of  Veer \\nSurendra Sai Activity\\nImagine that you are a nawab’s nephew and have been \\nbrought up thinking that you will one day be king.

By his time the Company had acquired power not only                 in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies:  Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \\nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. \\nEach district was to have two courts – a criminal court (faujdari adalat ) and a civil court ( diwani adalat ). Maulvis \\nand Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti \\nbut under the supervision of the collectors.

This led to an impeachment proceeding in the British Parliament that lasted seven years. \\nchap 1-4.indd   21 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n22 OUR PASTS – III\\nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave \\ndifferent interpretations of local laws based on different \\nschools of the dharmashastra . To bring about uniformity, \\nin 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta.\\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the \\nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas . \\nHis office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority.\\nThe Company army\\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given \\ntraining in archery ( teer-andazi ) and the use of the sword. \\nThe cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers.\\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when \\nMughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \\nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the \\ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of \\nthe Company’s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \\nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began  \\nto develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were Here is a passage from Edmund Burke’s eloquent opening speech during the impeachment of Warren Hastings:\\nI impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly in the name of human nature itself, in the name of both the sexes, in the name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all.Source 5\\n“I impeach the \\ncommon enemy and \\noppressor of all.”\\nDharmashastras – Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 \\nBCE onwards\\nSawar – Men on horses\\nMusket – A heavy gun \\nused by infantry soldiers\\nMatchlock – An early \\ntype of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match\\nchap 1-4.indd   22 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         23increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill \\nand discipline that regulated their life far more than before.

How did they react to the \\nchanges in their lives and their identity – that is, their sense of who they were? The Revolt of 1857 gives us a glimpse into the world of the sepoys.

The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \\nBy 1857, the Company came to exercise direct rule \\nover about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control.\\nFig. 16 – A sawar of Bengal in the \\nservice of the Company, painted by an unknown Indian artist, 1780\\nAfter the battles with the \\nMarathas and the Mysore rulers, the Company realised the importance of strengthening its cavalry force. \\nchap 1-4.indd   23 4/22/2022   2:49:43 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n24 OUR PASTS – III\\nLet’s recall\\n1.

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive’s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive’s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination.\\nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial \\nadministrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. Ruling the Countryside                   3\\nchap 1-4.indd   26 4/22/2022   2:49:47 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          27Over the years, the Company also learnt that it had to \\nmove with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed \\nto pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be  \\nentirely eliminated.\\nHow was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the \\nCompany came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted.\\nRevenue for the Company\\nThe Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years, the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \\nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep \\ncrisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out.\\nFig. 2 – A weekly market in Murshidabad in Bengal\\nPeasants and artisans \\nfrom rural areas regularly came to these weekly markets (haats) to sell their goods and buy what they needed. These markets were badly affected during times of economic crisis.\\nchap 1-4.indd   27 4/22/2022   2:49:47 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n28 OUR PASTS – IIIThe need to improve agriculture\\nIf the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain \\nof its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. \\nHow was this to be done? After two decades of debate \\non the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars  were recognised \\nas zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \\nThe problem\\nThe Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by  \\nthe Company.\\nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century, the \\nsituation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently.\\nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest \\nin improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \\nFig. 3 – Charles Cornwallis \\nCornwallis was the Governor-\\nGeneral of Bengal when the Permanent Settlement was introduced.\\nColebrook on \\nBengal ryots\\nIn many villages of  Bengal, some of the powerful ryots did not \\ncultivate, but instead gave out their lands to others (the under-tenants), taking from them very high rents. In 1806, H. T. Colebrook described the conditions of these under-tenants in Bengal:\\nThe under-tenants, depressed by an excessive rent in kind, and by usurious returns for the cattle, seed, and subsistence, advanced to them, can never extricate themselves from debt. In so abject a state, they cannot labour in spirit, while they earn a scanty subsistence without hope of bettering their situation. \\nActivity\\uf086\\nWhy do you think Colebrook is concerned with the conditions of the under-ryots in Bengal?

The rent he paid \\nto the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent, he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \\nA new system is devised\\nBy the early nineteenth century, many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed  more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \\nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal \\nPresidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each  village (mahal)  had to pay. This demand  was \\nto be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement.\\nThe Munro system\\nIn the British territories in the South, there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar  (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by \\nCaptain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India.\\nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were \\nno traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators ( ryots ) who \\nhad tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British Mahal – In British revenue records, mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages.\\nFig. 4 – Thomas Munro, Governor of Madras (1819 –26) \\nchap 1-4.indd   29 4/22/2022   2:49:49 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n30 OUR PASTS – IIIshould act as paternal father figures protecting the \\nryots under their charge.\\nAll was not well\\nWithin a few years after the new systems were imposed, it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages \\nbecame deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \\nCrops for Europe\\nThe British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century, the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice  \\nin Madras.\\nHow was this done? The British used a variety of methods \\nto expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production.\\nDoes colour have a history?\\nFigs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left  \\n(Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari  \\nprint created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India.

Do you know how this colour was produced?\\nThe blue that you see in these prints was produced \\nfrom a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \\nWhy the demand for Indian indigo?\\nThe indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\\nHowever, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached \\nthe European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo.\\nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo \\nproduced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts \\nof North America.\\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for \\nIndian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. \\nFrom where could this indigo be procured? \\nBritain turns to India\\nFaced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. Plantation – A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \\nchap 1-4.indd   31 4/22/2022   2:49:53 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n32 OUR PASTS – IIIFrom the last decades \\nof the eighteenth century, \\nindigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788, only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent.\\nAs the indigo trade \\ngrew, commercial agents and officials of the  Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by \\nthe prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time.\\nHow was indigo cultivated? \\nThere were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij \\nand ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter \\nproduced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \\nThe problem with nij cultivation\\nThe planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. \\nNor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation \\nrequired a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. Fig. 7 – The Slave Revolt in               St Domingue, August 1791,  painting by January Scuhodolski\\nIn the eighteenth century, French \\nplanters produced indigo and sugar in the French colony of St Domingue in the Caribbean islands. The African slaves who worked on the plantations rose in rebellion in 1791, burning the plantations and killing their rich planters. In 1792, France abolished slavery in the French colonies. These events led to the collapse of the indigo plantations on the Caribbean islands.\\nSlave – A person who is owned by someone else – the slave owner.

One bigha of indigo cultivation \\nrequired two ploughs. This meant that a planter with \\n1,000 bighas  would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing \\non purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. \\nTill the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore \\nreluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less \\nthan 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation – the ryoti system.\\nIndigo on the land of ryots\\nUnder the ryoti system, the planters \\nforced the ryots to sign a contract, \\nan agreement ( satta ). At times \\nthey pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who \\nsigned the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at \\nleast 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \\nFig. 8 – Workers harvesting indigo in early-nineteenth-century Bengal.

After harvest, the indigo plant was taken to the vats in \\nthe indigo factory. Three or four vats were needed to manufacture the dye. Each vat had a separate function. The leaves stripped off the indigo plant were first soaked in warm water in a vat (known as the fermenting or steeper vat) for several hours. When the plants fermented, the liquid began to boil and bubble. Now the rotten leaves were taken out and the liquid drained into another vat that was placed just below the first vat. \\nIn the second vat (known as the beater vat), the solution was \\ncontinuously stirred and beaten with paddles. When the liquid gradually turned green and then blue, lime water was added to the vat. Gradually the indigo separated out in flakes, a muddy sediment settled at the bottom of the vat and a clear liquid rose \\nto the surface. The liquid was drained off and the sediment – \\nthe indigo pulp – transferred to \\nanother vat (known as the \\nsettling vat), and then \\npressed and dried for \\nsale. \\nFermenting \\nVatBeater \\nVatHow was indigo produced?\\nchap 1-4.indd   34 4/22/2022   2:49:59 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          35\\nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the \\nharvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle \\nstarted all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted \\nby the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended.\\nThere were other problems too. The planters usually \\ninsisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \\nThe “Blue Rebellion” and After\\nIn March 1859, thousands of ryots in Bengal refused \\nto grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused \\nto pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas – \\nagents of planters – who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots  swore they would no longer take \\nadvances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters’ lathiyals – the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by  \\nthe planters.\\nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no \\nlonger remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. \\nIn 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the  support \\nof the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals . In other places even the zamindars went around \\nvillages urging the ryots  to resist the planters. These \\nzamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \\nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British \\ngovernment would support them in their struggle  against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857, the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts,   A song from an \\nindigo-producing \\nvillage\\nIn the moments of struggle, people often sing songs to inspire each other and to build a sense of collective unity. Such  songs give us a glimpse of their feelings. During the indigo rebellion, many such songs could be heard in the villages of lower Bengal. Here is one such song: \\nThe long lathis wielded by the  planter of Mollahati /now lie in a cluster\\nThe babus of Kolkata \\nhave sailed down /to see the great fight\\nThis time the raiyats \\nare all ready, / they \\nwill no longer be beaten in silence \\nThey will no longer \\ngive up their life / without fighting the lathiyals.Source 2\\nchap 1-4.indd   35 4/22/2022   2:49:59 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n36 OUR PASTS – III\\nthe Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter \\nof 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government \\nsympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not \\nbe compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \\nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta \\nrushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of \\nthe indigo system. \\nWorried by the rebellion, the government brought in \\nthe military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission \\nasked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told \\nthem that they could refuse to produce indigo in future.\\n “I would rather beg than sow indigo”\\nHadji Mulla, an indigo cultivator of Chandpore, Thana Hardi, was interviewed by the members of the Indigo Commission on Tuesday, 5 June 1860.

              "'Tribals, Dikus and the  \\nVision of a Golden Age4\\nIn 1895, a man named Birsa was seen roaming the forests and villages of Chottanagpur in Jharkhand. People said he had miraculous powers – he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, \\nbelieving that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve \\nall their problems.\\nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas – a tribal group \\nthat lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region – Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be  \\nin danger. \\nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? \\nWho were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter.\\nYou have read about tribal societies last \\nyear. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe  thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes.Fig. 1 – Women of the Dongria Kandha tribe in Orissa wade through  the river on the way to the market\\nchap 1-4.indd   39 4/22/2022   2:50:04 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n40 OUR PASTS – IIIHow did Tribal Groups Live?\\nBy the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts \\nof India were involved in a variety of activities. \\nSome were jhum cultivators\\nSome of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting \\ncultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for \\nseveral years, \\nShifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested \\ntracts of north-east and central India. The lives of  these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation.  \\nSome were hunters and gatherers\\nIn many regions, tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat \\namongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and \\nmahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs  for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum  and \\npalash  flowers to colour \\ntheir clothes and leather.\\nFallow – A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility\\nSal – A treeMahua – A flower that \\nis eaten or used to make alcohol\\nFig. 2 – Dongria Kandha women in Orissa take home pandanus leaves from the forest to make plates\\nchap 1-4.indd   40 4/22/2022   2:50:05 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n TRIBALS, DIKUS AND THE VISION OF A GOLDEN AGE          41From where did these forest \\npeople get their supplies of rice \\nand other grains? At times they exchanged goods – getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times, they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them – like the Baigas of central India – were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \\nTribal groups often needed \\nto buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \\nSome herded animals\\nMany tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons.  When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year.Fig. 3 – Location of some tribal groups in India\\nchap 1-4.indd   41 4/22/2022   2:50:06 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n42 OUR PASTS – III\\nA time to hunt, a time to sow, a time to move to a new field\\nHave you ever noticed that people living in different types of societies do not \\nshare the same notion of work and time? The lives of the shifting cultivators and hunters in different regions were regulated by a calendar and division of tasks for men and women. Verrier Elwin, a British anthropologist who lived among the Baigas and Khonds of central India for many years in the 1930s and 1940s, gives us a picture of what this calendar and division of tasks was like. He writes:  \\nIn Chait women went to clearings to ... cut stalks that were already reaped; \\nmen cut large trees and go for their ritual hunt. The hunt began at full moon from the east. Traps of bamboo were used for hunting. The women gathered fruits like sago, tamarind and mushroom. Baiga women can only gather roots or kanda and mahua seeds. Of all the adivasis in  Central India, the \\nBaigas were known as the best hunters … In Baisakh the firing of the forest \\ntook place, the women gathered unburnt wood to burn. Men continued to hunt, but nearer their villages. In Jeth sowing took place and hunting \\nstill went on. From Asadh to Bhadon the men worked in the fields. In Kuar  \\nthe first fruits of beans were ripened and in Kartik kutki became ripe. In \\nAghan every crop was ready and in Pus winnowing took place. Pus was also \\nthe time for dances and marriages.

They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves.\\nBritish officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds \\nand Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \\nHow did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?\\nThe lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were.\\nWhat happened to tribal chiefs?\\nBefore the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions.\\nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators?\\nThe British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal Bewar – A term used           in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation\\nFig. 5 – A log house being built in a village of the Nyishi tribes of  Arunachal Pradesh.\\nThe entire village helps when log \\nhuts are built.\\nchap 1-4.indd   43 4/22/2022   2:50:09 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n44 OUR PASTS – IIIgroups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. \\nSettled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land  settlements – that is, they \\nmeasured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state.\\nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not \\nvery successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum  cultivators in north-east India insisted \\non continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.Fig. 6 – Bhil women cultivating in a forest in Gujarat\\nShifting cultivation continues \\nin many forest areas of Gujarat. You can see that trees have been cut and land cleared to create patches for cultivation.\\nFig. 7 – Tribal workers in a rice field in Andhra Pradesh\\nNote the difference between rice cultivation in the flat plains and in \\nthe forests.\\nchap 1-4.indd   44 4/22/2022   2:50:10 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n TRIBALS, DIKUS AND THE VISION OF A GOLDEN AGE          45\\nForest laws and their impact\\nThe life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly \\nconnected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. \\nHow were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? \\nMany were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \\nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from \\nliving inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs?\\nColonial officials came up with a solution. They decided \\nthat they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land \\nin the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions, the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour.\\n“In this land of the English how hard it is to live”\\nIn the1930s Verrier Elwin visited the land of the Baigas – a tribal group in central India. He wanted to know about them – their customs and practices, their art and folklore. He recorded many songs that lamented the hard time the Baigas were having under British rule.\\nIn this land of the English how hard it is to liveHow hard it is to liveIn the village sits the landlordIn the gate sits the KotwarIn the garden sits the Patwari In the field sits the government\\nIn this land of the English how hard it is to live\\nTo pay cattle tax we have to sell cowTo pay forest tax we have to sell buffaloTo pay land tax we have to sell bullockHow are we to get our food?In this land of the English\\nQuoted in Verrier Elwin and Shamrao Hivale,  Songs of the Maikal, p. 316.Source 2Sleeper – The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid\\nchap 1-4.indd   45 4/22/2022   2:50:10 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n46 OUR PASTS – IIIFig. 8 – Godara women weaving\\nMany tribal groups reacted against the \\ncolonial forest laws. They disobeyed the \\nnew rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces.\\nThe problem with trade\\nDuring the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and money-lenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening.\\nLet us consider the case of the silk \\ngrowers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased \\nrapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \\nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area \\nwhere the Santhals reared cocoons. The \\ntraders dealing in silk sent in their agents \\nwho gave loans to the tribal people and \\ncollected the cocoons. The growers \\nwere paid ` 3 to ` 4 for a thousand \\ncocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or \\nGaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen – so called because they arranged deals \\nbetween the exporters and silk growers – made huge profits. The silk  \\ngrowers earned very little. Understandably, \\nmany tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies.  \\nFig. 9 – A Hajang woman weaving a mat\\nFor women, domestic \\nwork was not confined to the home.

From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work at the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home.\\nA Closer Look\\nThrough the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831–32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement.\\nFig. 10 – Coal miners of Bihar, 1948\\nIn the 1920s, about 50 per \\ncent of the miners in the Jharia and Raniganj coal mines of Bihar were tribals. Work deep down in the dark and suffocating mines was not only back-breaking and dangerous, it was often literally killing. In the 1920s, over 2,000 workers died every year in the coal mines in India.\\nActivity\\nFind out whether the conditions of work in the mines have changed now.

The son of a poor father, \\nhe grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara . Forced \\nby poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars  \\n(leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be \\na time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back \\ntheir kingdom.\\nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened \\nto the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their “bad practices”. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the \\nsacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety.\\nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he \\ncame in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life.\\nIn 1895, Birsa urged his followers to recover their \\nglorious past. He talked of  a golden age in the past – a satyug (the age of truth) – when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \\nWhat worried British officials most was the political \\naim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering.

They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \\nWhen Birsa was released in 1897, he began touring \\nthe villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy “Ravana” (dikus and the Europeans) and \\nestablish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa’s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and \\nEuropean power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj.  \\nIn 1900, Birsa died of cholera and the movement \\nfaded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First – it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second – it showed once again \\nthat the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle.\\nLet’s recall\\n1.

              "'From Trade to Territory                   \\nThe Company Establishes Power2\\nAurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He \\nestablished control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors ( subadars) and big zamindars \\nbegan asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre.\\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, \\nhowever, a new power was emerging on the political horizon – the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about.\\nFig. 1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson\\nAfter Aurangzeb there was no \\npowerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in  cold blood. \\nchap 1-4.indd   9 4/22/2022   2:49:25 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n10 OUR PASTS – IIIEast India Company \\nComes East\\nIn 1600, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter, the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods \\nat a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear.\\nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other \\nEuropean powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \\nThe problem was that all the companies were \\ninterested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of \\nFig. 2 –  Routes to India in the eighteenth century\\nMercantile – A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices\\nchap 1-4.indd   10 4/22/2022   2:49:26 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts \\nwere protected through fortification. \\nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable \\ntrade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \\nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of                  the river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which the Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696, it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later, it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting \\nthe Company the right to trade duty free.\\nThe Company tried continuously to press for \\nmore concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only the \\nCompany the right to trade duty free. But officials of  the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan,  \\nnot protest?\\nFig. 3 – Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras, painted by William Simpson, 1867Farman – A royal edict, a royal order\\nchap 1-4.indd   11 4/22/2022   2:49:27 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n12 OUR PASTS – IIIHow trade led to battles\\nThrough the early eighteenth century, the conflict between \\nthe Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust \\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts.    \\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated \\nin the famous Battle of Plassey.\\nThe Battle of Plassey \\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly \\ngive trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there. \\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, \\nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally,  in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for  \\nDid you know?\\nDid you know how Plassey \\ngot its name? Plassey is an anglicised pronunciation  of Palashi and the place derived its name from the palash  tree known for its \\nbeautiful red flowers that yield gulal , the powder \\nused in the festival of Holi.Fig. 4 – Robert Clive \\nPuppet – Literally, a toy \\nthat you can move with strings.

Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. \\nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major \\nvictory the Company won in India.

This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress.\\nThe promise of riches\\nThe territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. After the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt, one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch, on 7\\n January 1759 from Calcutta: \\nBut so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself … that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms: ... Now I leave you to judge, whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces … be an object deserving the public attention ...Source 1\\nFig. 6 –  Sirajuddaulah\\nchap 1-4.indd   13 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n14 OUR PASTS – III\\nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was \\nassassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company \\nwas still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather \\ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar \\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  \\nnawabs ourselves”.\\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the \\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.  \\nCompany officials become “nabobs”\\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs.Source 2\\nThe Nawab \\ncomplains\\nIn 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders:\\nWhen they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon, which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort, surrounded it  with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls. They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs. 100,000… they rob and plunder and carry great number of the king’s subjects of both sexes into slavery into their own country … \\nchap 1-4.indd   14 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         15After the Battle of Plassey, the actual nawabs of \\nBengal were forced to give land and vast sums of \\nmoney as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1767 he left India, his Indian fortune was worth £401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide  \\nin 1774. \\nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in \\nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war, and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called  \\n“nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \\nCompany Rule Expands\\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company \\nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes, the Company forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but \\nHow did Clive \\nsee himself?\\nAt his hearing in front  of a Committee in Parliament, Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey. This is what he said:\\nConsider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me! A great prince was dependent on my pleasure; an opulent city lay at my mercy; its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles; I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone, piled on either hand with gold and jewels! Mr Chairman, at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.Source 3\\nImagine that you are a young Company official  who has been in India for a few months.

If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor-General (1798–1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\\nWhat power did the Resident have?\\nThis is what James Mill, the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland, wrote about the residents appointed by the Company. \\nWe place a resident, who really is king of the country, whatever injunctions of non-interference he may act under. As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience, and does what is agreeable \\nto the residents, that is, to the British Government, things go on quietly; they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs … but when anything of a different nature happens, the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong, then comes clashing and disturbance.\\nJames Mill (1832)\\nTipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore”\\nThe Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore.\\nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership \\nof powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1761 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close \\nFig. 8  – Tipu Sultan\\nchap 1-4.indd   16 4/22/2022   2:49:32 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         17relationship with the French in India, and modernised \\nhis army with their help. \\nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu \\nas ambitious, arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1767–69, 1780–84, 1790–92 and 1799). Only in the last – the Battle of Seringapatam – did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \\nFig. 10 – Tipu’s toy tiger \\nThis is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.  \\nYou can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle was turned, the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  toy-tiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799.Fig. 9 – Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages, painted by Daniel Orme, 1793\\nThe Company forces were \\ndefeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles. But in 1792, attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company, Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were  taken away as hostages. British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of  British power.\\nThe legend of Tipu\\nKings are often surrounded \\nby legend and their powers glorified through folklore. Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782. It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend. There he came face to face with a tiger. His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground. He battled with the tiger unarmed until he  managed to reach down and pick up the dagger. Finally, he was able to kill the tiger in the battle. After this, he came to be known as the “Tiger of Mysore”. He had the image of the tiger on his flag. \\nchap 1-4.indd   17 4/22/2022   2:49:34 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n18 OUR PASTS – IIIWar with the Marathas \\nFrom the late eighteenth century, the Company also \\nsought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy  under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) \\nwho became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. \\nIn the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817–19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \\nThe claim to paramountcy\\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For \\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, \\ncarried on the resistance. With popular support, he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in  \\nthe book.Fig. 11 – Lord Hastings. \\n \\nConfederacy – AllianceActivity\\nImagine that you have   come across two old  newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan.

Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842, and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab  \\nwas annexed.\\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\\nThe final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would “lapse”, that is, become a part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and  \\nJhansi (1854). \\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. \\nThis time the British had an added argument – they said they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \\nFig. 13  – Maharaja Ranjit Singh holding court  \\nFig. 14   – A portrait of  Veer \\nSurendra Sai Activity\\nImagine that you are a nawab’s nephew and have been \\nbrought up thinking that you will one day be king.

By his time the Company had acquired power not only                 in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies:  Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \\nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. \\nEach district was to have two courts – a criminal court (faujdari adalat ) and a civil court ( diwani adalat ). Maulvis \\nand Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti \\nbut under the supervision of the collectors. Qazi – A judge\\nMufti – A jurist of the \\nMuslim community responsible for expounding the law           that the qazi would administer\\nImpeachment – A trial \\nby the House of Lords           in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons\\nFig. 15 – The trial of Warren Hastings, painted by R.G. Pollard, 1789\\nWhen Warren Hastings went back to England in 1785, Edmund Burke accused him \\nof being personally responsible for the misgovernment of Bengal. This led to an impeachment proceeding in the British Parliament that lasted seven years. \\nchap 1-4.indd   21 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n22 OUR PASTS – III\\nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave \\ndifferent interpretations of local laws based on different \\nschools of the dharmashastra . To bring about uniformity, \\nin 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta.\\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the \\nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas . \\nHis office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority.\\nThe Company army\\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given \\ntraining in archery ( teer-andazi ) and the use of the sword. \\nThe cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers.\\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when \\nMughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \\nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the \\ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of \\nthe Company’s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \\nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began  \\nto develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were Here is a passage from Edmund Burke’s eloquent opening speech during the impeachment of Warren Hastings:\\nI impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly in the name of human nature itself, in the name of both the sexes, in the name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all.Source 5\\n“I impeach the \\ncommon enemy and \\noppressor of all.”\\nDharmashastras – Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 \\nBCE onwards\\nSawar – Men on horses\\nMusket – A heavy gun \\nused by infantry soldiers\\nMatchlock – An early \\ntype of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match\\nchap 1-4.indd   22 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         23increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill \\nand discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \\nWhat did the sepoys feel? How did they react to the \\nchanges in their lives and their identity – that is, their sense of who they were? The Revolt of 1857 gives us a glimpse into the world of the sepoys. You will read about this revolt in Chapter 5.\\nConclusion\\nThus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \\nBy 1857, the Company came to exercise direct rule \\nover about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control.\\nFig. 16 – A sawar of Bengal in the \\nservice of the Company, painted by an unknown Indian artist, 1780\\nAfter the battles with the \\nMarathas and the Mysore rulers, the Company realised the importance of strengthening its cavalry force. \\nchap 1-4.indd   23 4/22/2022   2:49:43 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n24 OUR PASTS – III\\nLet’s recall\\n1.

He \\nestablished control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors ( subadars) and big zamindars \\nbegan asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre.\\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, \\nhowever, a new power was emerging on the political horizon – the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about.\\nFig. 1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson\\nAfter Aurangzeb there was no \\npowerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in  cold blood. \\nchap 1-4.indd   9 4/22/2022   2:49:25 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n10 OUR PASTS – IIIEast India Company \\nComes East\\nIn 1600, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter, the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods \\nat a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear.\\nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other \\nEuropean powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \\nThe problem was that all the companies were \\ninterested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of \\nFig. 2 –  Routes to India in the eighteenth century\\nMercantile – A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices\\nchap 1-4.indd   10 4/22/2022   2:49:26 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts \\nwere protected through fortification. \\nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable \\ntrade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \\nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of                  the river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which the Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696, it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later, it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting \\nthe Company the right to trade duty free.\\nThe Company tried continuously to press for \\nmore concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only the \\nCompany the right to trade duty free. But officials of  the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan,  \\nnot protest?\\nFig. 3 – Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras, painted by William Simpson, 1867Farman – A royal edict, a royal order\\nchap 1-4.indd   11 4/22/2022   2:49:27 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n12 OUR PASTS – IIIHow trade led to battles\\nThrough the early eighteenth century, the conflict between \\nthe Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust \\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts.    \\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated \\nin the famous Battle of Plassey.\\nThe Battle of Plassey \\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly \\ngive trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there. \\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, \\nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally,  in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for  \\nDid you know?\\nDid you know how Plassey \\ngot its name? Plassey is an anglicised pronunciation  of Palashi and the place derived its name from the palash  tree known for its \\nbeautiful red flowers that yield gulal , the powder \\nused in the festival of Holi.Fig. 4 – Robert Clive \\nPuppet – Literally, a toy \\nthat you can move with strings.

Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. \\nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major \\nvictory the Company won in India. Fig. 5 – The General Court Room, East India House, Leadenhall Street\\nThe Court of \\nProprietors of the East India Company had their meetings in the East India House on Leadenhall Street in London. This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress.\\nThe promise of riches\\nThe territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. After the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt, one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch, on 7\\n January 1759 from Calcutta: \\nBut so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself … that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms: ... Now I leave you to judge, whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces … be an object deserving the public attention ...Source 1\\nFig. 6 –  Sirajuddaulah\\nchap 1-4.indd   13 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n14 OUR PASTS – III\\nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was \\nassassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company \\nwas still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather \\ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar \\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  \\nnawabs ourselves”.\\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the \\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.  \\nCompany officials become “nabobs”\\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs.Source 2\\nThe Nawab \\ncomplains\\nIn 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders:\\nWhen they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon, which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort, surrounded it  with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls. They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs. 100,000… they rob and plunder and carry great number of the king’s subjects of both sexes into slavery into their own country … \\nchap 1-4.indd   14 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         15After the Battle of Plassey, the actual nawabs of \\nBengal were forced to give land and vast sums of \\nmoney as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1767 he left India, his Indian fortune was worth £401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide  \\nin 1774. \\nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in \\nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war, and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called  \\n“nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \\nCompany Rule Expands\\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company \\nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes, the Company forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but \\nHow did Clive \\nsee himself?\\nAt his hearing in front  of a Committee in Parliament, Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey. This is what he said:\\nConsider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me! A great prince was dependent on my pleasure; an opulent city lay at my mercy; its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles; I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone, piled on either hand with gold and jewels! Mr Chairman, at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.Source 3\\nImagine that you are a young Company official  who has been in India for a few months.

If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor-General (1798–1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\\nWhat power did the Resident have?\\nThis is what James Mill, the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland, wrote about the residents appointed by the Company. \\nWe place a resident, who really is king of the country, whatever injunctions of non-interference he may act under. As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience, and does what is agreeable \\nto the residents, that is, to the British Government, things go on quietly; they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs … but when anything of a different nature happens, the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong, then comes clashing and disturbance.\\nJames Mill (1832)\\nTipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore”\\nThe Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore.\\nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership \\nof powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1761 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close \\nFig. 8  – Tipu Sultan\\nchap 1-4.indd   16 4/22/2022   2:49:32 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         17relationship with the French in India, and modernised \\nhis army with their help. \\nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu \\nas ambitious, arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1767–69, 1780–84, 1790–92 and 1799). Only in the last – the Battle of Seringapatam – did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \\nFig. 10 – Tipu’s toy tiger \\nThis is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.  \\nYou can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle was turned, the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  toy-tiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799.Fig. 9 – Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages, painted by Daniel Orme, 1793\\nThe Company forces were \\ndefeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles. But in 1792, attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company, Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were  taken away as hostages. British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of  British power.\\nThe legend of Tipu\\nKings are often surrounded \\nby legend and their powers glorified through folklore. Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782. It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend. There he came face to face with a tiger. His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground. He battled with the tiger unarmed until he  managed to reach down and pick up the dagger. Finally, he was able to kill the tiger in the battle. After this, he came to be known as the “Tiger of Mysore”. He had the image of the tiger on his flag. \\nchap 1-4.indd   17 4/22/2022   2:49:34 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n18 OUR PASTS – IIIWar with the Marathas \\nFrom the late eighteenth century, the Company also \\nsought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy  under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) \\nwho became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. \\nIn the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817–19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \\nThe claim to paramountcy\\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For \\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, \\ncarried on the resistance. With popular support, he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in  \\nthe book.Fig. 11 – Lord Hastings. \\n \\nConfederacy – AllianceActivity\\nImagine that you have   come across two old  newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan.

Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842, and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab  \\nwas annexed.\\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\\nThe final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would “lapse”, that is, become a part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and  \\nJhansi (1854). \\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. \\nThis time the British had an added argument – they said they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \\nFig. 13  – Maharaja Ranjit Singh holding court  \\nFig. 14   – A portrait of  Veer \\nSurendra Sai Activity\\nImagine that you are a nawab’s nephew and have been \\nbrought up thinking that you will one day be king.

By his time the Company had acquired power not only                 in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies:  Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \\nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. \\nEach district was to have two courts – a criminal court (faujdari adalat ) and a civil court ( diwani adalat ). Maulvis \\nand Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti \\nbut under the supervision of the collectors.

To bring about uniformity, \\nin 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta.\\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the \\nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas . \\nHis office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority.\\nThe Company army\\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given \\ntraining in archery ( teer-andazi ) and the use of the sword. \\nThe cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers.\\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when \\nMughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \\nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the \\ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks.

The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \\nBy 1857, the Company came to exercise direct rule \\nover about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control.\\nFig. 16 – A sawar of Bengal in the \\nservice of the Company, painted by an unknown Indian artist, 1780\\nAfter the battles with the \\nMarathas and the Mysore rulers, the Company realised the importance of strengthening its cavalry force. \\nchap 1-4.indd   23 4/22/2022   2:49:43 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n24 OUR PASTS – III\\nLet’s recall\\n1.

              " 'chapter_3': 'Fig. 1 – Robert Clive \\naccepting  the Diwani          of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa from the Mughal ruler in 1765\\nThe Company Becomes the Diwan\\nOn 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive’s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive’s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination.\\nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial \\nadministrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. Ruling the Countryside                   3\\nchap 1-4.indd   26 4/22/2022   2:49:47 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          27Over the years, the Company also learnt that it had to \\nmove with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed \\nto pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be  \\nentirely eliminated.\\nHow was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the \\nCompany came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted.\\nRevenue for the Company\\nThe Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years, the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \\nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep \\ncrisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out.\\nFig. 2 – A weekly market in Murshidabad in Bengal\\nPeasants and artisans \\nfrom rural areas regularly came to these weekly markets (haats) to sell their goods and buy what they needed. These markets were badly affected during times of economic crisis.\\nchap 1-4.indd   27 4/22/2022   2:49:47 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n28 OUR PASTS – IIIThe need to improve agriculture\\nIf the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain \\nof its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. \\nHow was this to be done? After two decades of debate \\non the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars  were recognised \\nas zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \\nThe problem\\nThe Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by  \\nthe Company.\\nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century, the \\nsituation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently.\\nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest \\nin improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \\nFig. 3 – Charles Cornwallis \\nCornwallis was the Governor-\\nGeneral of Bengal when the Permanent Settlement was introduced.\\nColebrook on \\nBengal ryots\\nIn many villages of  Bengal, some of the powerful ryots did not \\ncultivate, but instead gave out their lands to others (the under-tenants), taking from them very high rents. In 1806, H. T. Colebrook described the conditions of these under-tenants in Bengal:\\nThe under-tenants, depressed by an excessive rent in kind, and by usurious returns for the cattle, seed, and subsistence, advanced to them, can never extricate themselves from debt. In so abject a state, they cannot labour in spirit, while they earn a scanty subsistence without hope of bettering their situation. \\nActivity\\uf086\\nWhy do you think Colebrook is concerned with the conditions of the under-ryots in Bengal? Read the preceding pages and suggest possible reasons.

The rent he paid \\nto the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent, he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \\nA new system is devised\\nBy the early nineteenth century, many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed  more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \\nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal \\nPresidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each  village (mahal)  had to pay. This demand  was \\nto be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement.\\nThe Munro system\\nIn the British territories in the South, there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar  (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by \\nCaptain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India.\\nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were \\nno traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators ( ryots ) who \\nhad tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British Mahal – In British revenue records, mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages.\\nFig. 4 – Thomas Munro, Governor of Madras (1819 –26) \\nchap 1-4.indd   29 4/22/2022   2:49:49 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n30 OUR PASTS – IIIshould act as paternal father figures protecting the \\nryots under their charge.\\nAll was not well\\nWithin a few years after the new systems were imposed, it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages \\nbecame deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \\nCrops for Europe\\nThe British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century, the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice  \\nin Madras.\\nHow was this done? The British used a variety of methods \\nto expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production.\\nDoes colour have a history?\\nFigs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left  \\n(Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari  \\nprint created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain.

Do you know how this colour was produced?\\nThe blue that you see in these prints was produced \\nfrom a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \\nWhy the demand for Indian indigo?\\nThe indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\\nHowever, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached \\nthe European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo.\\nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo \\nproduced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts \\nof North America.\\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for \\nIndian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. \\nFrom where could this indigo be procured? \\nBritain turns to India\\nFaced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation.

Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \\nchap 1-4.indd   31 4/22/2022   2:49:53 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n32 OUR PASTS – IIIFrom the last decades \\nof the eighteenth century, \\nindigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788, only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent.\\nAs the indigo trade \\ngrew, commercial agents and officials of the  Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by \\nthe prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time.\\nHow was indigo cultivated? \\nThere were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij \\nand ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter \\nproduced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \\nThe problem with nij cultivation\\nThe planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. \\nNor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation \\nrequired a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. Fig. 7 – The Slave Revolt in               St Domingue, August 1791,  painting by January Scuhodolski\\nIn the eighteenth century, French \\nplanters produced indigo and sugar in the French colony of St Domingue in the Caribbean islands. The African slaves who worked on the plantations rose in rebellion in 1791, burning the plantations and killing their rich planters. In 1792, France abolished slavery in the French colonies. These events led to the collapse of the indigo plantations on the Caribbean islands.\\nSlave – A person who is owned by someone else – the slave owner.

One bigha of indigo cultivation \\nrequired two ploughs. This meant that a planter with \\n1,000 bighas  would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing \\non purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. \\nTill the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore \\nreluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less \\nthan 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation – the ryoti system.\\nIndigo on the land of ryots\\nUnder the ryoti system, the planters \\nforced the ryots to sign a contract, \\nan agreement ( satta ). At times \\nthey pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who \\nsigned the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at \\nleast 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \\nFig. 8 – Workers harvesting indigo in early-nineteenth-century Bengal.

After harvest, the indigo plant was taken to the vats in \\nthe indigo factory. Three or four vats were needed to manufacture the dye. Each vat had a separate function. The leaves stripped off the indigo plant were first soaked in warm water in a vat (known as the fermenting or steeper vat) for several hours. When the plants fermented, the liquid began to boil and bubble. Now the rotten leaves were taken out and the liquid drained into another vat that was placed just below the first vat. \\nIn the second vat (known as the beater vat), the solution was \\ncontinuously stirred and beaten with paddles. When the liquid gradually turned green and then blue, lime water was added to the vat. Gradually the indigo separated out in flakes, a muddy sediment settled at the bottom of the vat and a clear liquid rose \\nto the surface. The liquid was drained off and the sediment – \\nthe indigo pulp – transferred to \\nanother vat (known as the \\nsettling vat), and then \\npressed and dried for \\nsale. \\nFermenting \\nVatBeater \\nVatHow was indigo produced?\\nchap 1-4.indd   34 4/22/2022   2:49:59 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          35\\nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the \\nharvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle \\nstarted all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted \\nby the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended.\\nThere were other problems too. The planters usually \\ninsisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \\nThe “Blue Rebellion” and After\\nIn March 1859, thousands of ryots in Bengal refused \\nto grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused \\nto pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas – \\nagents of planters – who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots  swore they would no longer take \\nadvances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters’ lathiyals – the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by  \\nthe planters.\\nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no \\nlonger remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. \\nIn 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the  support \\nof the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals . In other places even the zamindars went around \\nvillages urging the ryots  to resist the planters. These \\nzamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \\nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British \\ngovernment would support them in their struggle  against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857, the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts,   A song from an \\nindigo-producing \\nvillage\\nIn the moments of struggle, people often sing songs to inspire each other and to build a sense of collective unity. Such  songs give us a glimpse of their feelings. During the indigo rebellion, many such songs could be heard in the villages of lower Bengal. Here is one such song: \\nThe long lathis wielded by the  planter of Mollahati /now lie in a cluster\\nThe babus of Kolkata \\nhave sailed down /to see the great fight\\nThis time the raiyats \\nare all ready, / they \\nwill no longer be beaten in silence \\nThey will no longer \\ngive up their life / without fighting the lathiyals.Source 2\\nchap 1-4.indd   35 4/22/2022   2:49:59 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n36 OUR PASTS – III\\nthe Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter \\nof 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government \\nsympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not \\nbe compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \\nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta \\nrushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of \\nthe indigo system. \\nWorried by the rebellion, the government brought in \\nthe military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission \\nasked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told \\nthem that they could refuse to produce indigo in future.\\n “I would rather beg than sow indigo”\\nHadji Mulla, an indigo cultivator of Chandpore, Thana Hardi, was interviewed by the members of the Indigo Commission on Tuesday, 5 June 1860.

              " 'chapter_4': 'Tribals, Dikus and the  \\nVision of a Golden Age4\\nIn 1895, a man named Birsa was seen roaming the forests and villages of Chottanagpur in Jharkhand. People said he had miraculous powers – he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, \\nbelieving that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve \\nall their problems.\\nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas – a tribal group \\nthat lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region – Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be  \\nin danger. \\nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? \\nWho were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter.\\nYou have read about tribal societies last \\nyear. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe  thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes.Fig. 1 – Women of the Dongria Kandha tribe in Orissa wade through  the river on the way to the market\\nchap 1-4.indd   39 4/22/2022   2:50:04 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n40 OUR PASTS – IIIHow did Tribal Groups Live?\\nBy the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts \\nof India were involved in a variety of activities. \\nSome were jhum cultivators\\nSome of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting \\ncultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for \\nseveral years, \\nShifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested \\ntracts of north-east and central India. The lives of  these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation.  \\nSome were hunters and gatherers\\nIn many regions, tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat \\namongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and \\nmahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs  for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum  and \\npalash  flowers to colour \\ntheir clothes and leather.\\nFallow – A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility\\nSal – A treeMahua – A flower that \\nis eaten or used to make alcohol\\nFig. 2 – Dongria Kandha women in Orissa take home pandanus leaves from the forest to make plates\\nchap 1-4.indd   40 4/22/2022   2:50:05 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n TRIBALS, DIKUS AND THE VISION OF A GOLDEN AGE          41From where did these forest \\npeople get their supplies of rice \\nand other grains? At times they exchanged goods – getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times, they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them – like the Baigas of central India – were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \\nTribal groups often needed \\nto buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \\nSome herded animals\\nMany tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons.  When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year.Fig. 3 – Location of some tribal groups in India\\nchap 1-4.indd   41 4/22/2022   2:50:06 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n42 OUR PASTS – III\\nA time to hunt, a time to sow, a time to move to a new field\\nHave you ever noticed that people living in different types of societies do not \\nshare the same notion of work and time? The lives of the shifting cultivators and hunters in different regions were regulated by a calendar and division of tasks for men and women. Verrier Elwin, a British anthropologist who lived among the Baigas and Khonds of central India for many years in the 1930s and 1940s, gives us a picture of what this calendar and division of tasks was like. He writes:  \\nIn Chait women went to clearings to ... cut stalks that were already reaped; \\nmen cut large trees and go for their ritual hunt. The hunt began at full moon from the east. Traps of bamboo were used for hunting. The women gathered fruits like sago, tamarind and mushroom. Baiga women can only gather roots or kanda and mahua seeds. Of all the adivasis in  Central India, the \\nBaigas were known as the best hunters … In Baisakh the firing of the forest \\ntook place, the women gathered unburnt wood to burn. Men continued to hunt, but nearer their villages. In Jeth sowing took place and hunting \\nstill went on. From Asadh to Bhadon the men worked in the fields. In Kuar  \\nthe first fruits of beans were ripened and in Kartik kutki became ripe. In \\nAghan every crop was ready and in Pus winnowing took place. Pus was also \\nthe time for dances and marriages. In Magh shifts were made to new bewars  \\nand hunting-gathering was the main subsistence activity. \\nThe cycle described above took \\nplace in the first year. In the second year there was more time for hunting as only a few crops had to be sown and harvested. But since there was enough food the men lived in the bewars. It was only in the third year that the diet had to be supplemented with the forest products.\\nAdapted from Verrier Elwin, Baiga (1939) and Elwin’s \\nunpublished ‘Notes on the Khonds’ (Verrier Elwin \\nPapers, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library)Source 1\\nFig. 4 – A Santhal girl carrying firewood, Bihar, 1946\\nChildren go with their mothers to the forest \\nto gather forest produce.\\uf086Activity\\nLook carefully at the tasks that Baiga men and women did.

They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves.\\nBritish officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds \\nand Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \\nHow did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?\\nThe lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were.\\nWhat happened to tribal chiefs?\\nBefore the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions.\\nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators?\\nThe British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal Bewar – A term used           in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation\\nFig. 5 – A log house being built in a village of the Nyishi tribes of  Arunachal Pradesh.\\nThe entire village helps when log \\nhuts are built.\\nchap 1-4.indd   43 4/22/2022   2:50:09 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n44 OUR PASTS – IIIgroups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. \\nSettled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land  settlements – that is, they \\nmeasured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state.\\nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not \\nvery successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum  cultivators in north-east India insisted \\non continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.Fig. 6 – Bhil women cultivating in a forest in Gujarat\\nShifting cultivation continues \\nin many forest areas of Gujarat. You can see that trees have been cut and land cleared to create patches for cultivation.\\nFig. 7 – Tribal workers in a rice field in Andhra Pradesh\\nNote the difference between rice cultivation in the flat plains and in \\nthe forests.\\nchap 1-4.indd   44 4/22/2022   2:50:10 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n TRIBALS, DIKUS AND THE VISION OF A GOLDEN AGE          45\\nForest laws and their impact\\nThe life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly \\nconnected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. \\nHow were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? \\nMany were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \\nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from \\nliving inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs?\\nColonial officials came up with a solution. They decided \\nthat they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land \\nin the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions, the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour.\\n“In this land of the English how hard it is to live”\\nIn the1930s Verrier Elwin visited the land of the Baigas – a tribal group in central India. He wanted to know about them – their customs and practices, their art and folklore. He recorded many songs that lamented the hard time the Baigas were having under British rule.\\nIn this land of the English how hard it is to liveHow hard it is to liveIn the village sits the landlordIn the gate sits the KotwarIn the garden sits the Patwari In the field sits the government\\nIn this land of the English how hard it is to live\\nTo pay cattle tax we have to sell cowTo pay forest tax we have to sell buffaloTo pay land tax we have to sell bullockHow are we to get our food?In this land of the English\\nQuoted in Verrier Elwin and Shamrao Hivale,  Songs of the Maikal, p. 316.Source 2Sleeper – The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid\\nchap 1-4.indd   45 4/22/2022   2:50:10 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n46 OUR PASTS – IIIFig. 8 – Godara women weaving\\nMany tribal groups reacted against the \\ncolonial forest laws. They disobeyed the \\nnew rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces.\\nThe problem with trade\\nDuring the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and money-lenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening.\\nLet us consider the case of the silk \\ngrowers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased \\nrapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \\nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area \\nwhere the Santhals reared cocoons. The \\ntraders dealing in silk sent in their agents \\nwho gave loans to the tribal people and \\ncollected the cocoons. The growers \\nwere paid ` 3 to ` 4 for a thousand \\ncocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or \\nGaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen – so called because they arranged deals \\nbetween the exporters and silk growers – made huge profits. The silk  \\ngrowers earned very little. Understandably, \\nmany tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies.  \\nFig. 9 – A Hajang woman weaving a mat\\nFor women, domestic \\nwork was not confined to the home.

From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work at the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home.\\nA Closer Look\\nThrough the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831–32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement.\\nFig. 10 – Coal miners of Bihar, 1948\\nIn the 1920s, about 50 per \\ncent of the miners in the Jharia and Raniganj coal mines of Bihar were tribals. Work deep down in the dark and suffocating mines was not only back-breaking and dangerous, it was often literally killing. In the 1920s, over 2,000 workers died every year in the coal mines in India.\\nActivity\\nFind out whether the conditions of work in the mines have changed now.

The son of a poor father, \\nhe grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara . Forced \\nby poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars  \\n(leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be \\na time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back \\ntheir kingdom.\\nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened \\nto the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their “bad practices”. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the \\nsacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety.\\nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he \\ncame in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life.\\nIn 1895, Birsa urged his followers to recover their \\nglorious past. He talked of  a golden age in the past – a satyug (the age of truth) – when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \\nWhat worried British officials most was the political \\naim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering.

They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \\nWhen Birsa was released in 1897, he began touring \\nthe villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy “Ravana” (dikus and the Europeans) and \\nestablish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa’s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and \\nEuropean power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj.  \\nIn 1900, Birsa died of cholera and the movement \\nfaded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First – it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second – it showed once again \\nthat the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle.\\nLet’s recall\\n1.
